You may notice the two subdirectories. 
There are basically two project managed by mix.
This is the only way to reasonably support command line arguments.
The process for compiling is as follows:
 From client directory excute the following command,
  mix escript.build
 From server directory execute the following command,
  mix escript.build

To execute you will need to be in the respective directories and run
./server
./client 127.0.0.1

The source code is in the lib directory of each sub-directory (server and client). 

You will need Elixir and Mix to run this application.
